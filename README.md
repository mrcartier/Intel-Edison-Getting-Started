# Intel-Edison-Getting-Started
Instructions on how to get the board up and running on OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 with the mini breakout board. There's more than enough tutorials, walkthroughs, etc. for RPi, BBB and the others but had to go to several different sites for the Edison. Also, a good deal of info that's available focuses on the Arduino expansion board.

#INSTRUCTIONS
1. Download PhoneFlashToolLite_5.3.2.0_mac64.pkg (http://downloadmirror.intel.com/25384/eng/edison-iotdk-image-280915.zip)
2. Download edison-iotdk-image-280915.zip which it contains Yocto 2.1 (http://downloadmirror.intel.com/25384/eng/PhoneFlashToolLite_5.3.2.0_mac64.pkg) 

3. Assemble the board. Put the module on the breakout board, lining up the holes on the module with the screws on the breakout board. Press down on the module at the upper left corner and just below the words What will you make? until you feel it click into place. Use the two hex nuts to secure the module to the expansion board.
